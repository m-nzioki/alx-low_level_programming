Project: 0x02. C - Functions, nested loop

Tasks follow the betty coding style.
No global varibles are allowed.
Only putchar is allowed to display text to output unless otherwise stated.
Because of this, the ASCII values are used to specify which characters
are being displayed on the screen.
The ASCII value of 0 is 48 otherwise written as '0'
So any mention of 48 within putchar is refering to 0.
The main.h is a header file containing all the tasks functions in the project.

0-putchar.c - prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

1-alphabet.c - prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

2-print_alphabet_x10.c - prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3-islower.c - checks for a lowercase character.

4-isalpha.c - checks for alphabetic character.

5-sign.c - prints the sign of a number.

6-abs.c - computes the absolute value of an integer.

7-print_last_digit.c - prints the last digit of a number.

8-24_hours.c - prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59

9-times_table.c - prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

10-add.c - adds two integers and returns the result.

11-print_to_98.c -  prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
This task allows for the use of the stdlib. Thats why printf is used in place of _putchar.

ADVANCED TASKS

100-times_table.c - prints the n times table, starting with 0.
Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function does not print anything

101-natural.c - computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
The stdlib is allowed 

102-fibonacci.c - prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
stdlib is allowed

103-fibonacci.c - finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the fibonacci series.
The values must not exceed 4000000.
