0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

Project Instructions

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden unless otherwise stated.

You are allowed to use _putchar.

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h.

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

All your files should end with a new line

TASKS
0-isupper.c - checks for uppercase character.

1-isdigit.c - checks for a digit (0 through 9)

2-mul.c -  multiplies two integers

3-print_numbers.c - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9

4-print_most_numbers.c - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.

5-more_numbers.c - prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14

6-print_line.c - draws a straight line in the terminal.

7-print_diagonal.c - draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8-print_square.c - prints a square, followed by a new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c - prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three it prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five it prints Buzz. 
For multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints FizzBuzz
The Standard library is allowed

10-print_triangle.c - prints a triangle

ADVANCED TASKS
100-prime_factor.c - finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.
The std library is allowed.

101-print_number.c -  prints an integer. Only putchar is allowed. Long, arrays, pointers are not allowed.
No value should be hard coded.
